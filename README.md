# weekly
Week1
I spent about 15 hours studying this week
On the basis of having learned the c language, I have also done some work on the content of the c++ , and have preliminarily understood some operations under the Linux environment. Then I also learned some Git contents, and I can simply complete some preliminary tasks. At the same time, I also had a preliminary study of unix network programming, but I didn't learn enough about some details due to a short time.
Next week I plan to study the computer network well, and then preliminarily complete the task, and re learn some details of the first week to consolidate.
